J Query

syntax:

everything is written inside the script tag just like we write in javascript.
jquery is basically just a framework of javascrpt so it is almost similar but easier to use.

every jquery element starts with a {$} symbol.

$("circle").click(function() { } );

so basically this is how we write in jq. it is a short way of writing
 
document.getElementById("").onclick = function() {}
